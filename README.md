## Introduction

The aim of this project is to visualize locally whether a given CS2 account (via a STEAMID) has collected its weekly reward and to tell it when it can collect its next reward. Having several CS2 accounts, I quickly got tired of opening each game to see if I'd collected my weekly care packages.
